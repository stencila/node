      Hello! This is a Stencila Host running in Node.js. You can connect
      a Stencila client (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/stencila/desktop">Stencila Desktop</a>)
      to it and ask for execution contexts (e.g. for running SQL).
    </p>
    <p>
      To connect to this host use the URL (containing a security ticket) that was printed in the console
      where you started it. Or, if this host was launched automatically for you but you need
      to connect manually, get the ticket from the host file created in your file system's temporary directory
      e.g. <code>/tmp/stencila/hosts</code> on MacOS and Linux. See the <a href="http://docs.stenci.la">documentation</a> for more.
